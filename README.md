# Password-Strength-Analyzer-Python
A robust tool for evaluating password complexity and security, providing real-time feedback
# 🔒 Robust Password Strength Analyzer (Python)

## Overview
This project is a critical cybersecurity utility designed to evaluate the complexity and security of user passwords in real-time. It provides immediate feedback, encouraging the adoption of stronger access credentials, which is vital for reducing authentication vulnerabilities.

## ✨ Features
* **Multi-Criteria Scoring:** Analyzes passwords based on length, inclusion of uppercase/lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
* **Real-time Feedback:** Provides instant strength rating (e.g., Weak, Moderate, Strong, Excellent) as the user types.
* **Suggestion Engine:** Offers actionable advice to the user on how to improve a weak or moderate password.
* **Technical Stack:** Python 3.x, focused on robust string manipulation and algorithmic complexity analysis.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🖥️ Usage
Execute the main script to start the analyzer:
```bash
python password_analyzer.py 
# (Replace 'password_analyzer.py' with the actual name of your main script)
